# Roman-Numeral-to-Arabic-Numeral-Converter
Takes a .txt file consisting of Roman numerals as input and then converts each Roman numeral to its respective Arabic numeral value while also sorting each Roman numeral by its value using a TreeMap. HashMaps are also used in this project to handle the conversions between individual Roman numeral characters to their respective Arabic numeral equivalencies.
